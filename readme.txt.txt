This is a simulation program that represents people that wander across a landscape in search of food. People are agents that may choose to wander or settle during a time step, depending on the amounts and locations of food visible from their current locations. The amount of fruit naturally increases over time.

All software here was created by William Boyd of Arizona State University.
