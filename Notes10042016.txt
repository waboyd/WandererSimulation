Software complexity testing should be designed for a specific application. (p. 1044)

"Measures [of complexity] typically depend on program size, control structure, or the nature of module interfaces." (p. 1044)

Halstead measures:
   The volume of a program is V = (N_1 + N_2)log_2(n_1 + n_2)
	where
	n_1 is the number of unique operators,
	n_2 is the number of unique operands,
	N_1 is the total number of operators,
	N_2 is the total number of operands.	(p. 1-2)

   The difficulty of the program is D = (n_1 X N_2) / (2n_2)	(p. 2)
