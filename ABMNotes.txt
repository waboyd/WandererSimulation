I should make a simple agent-based model with a corresponding simulator.  The model should allow variable amounts for scale.  Scaling variables should include the number of agents and the size of the landscape that the agents use.  Perhaps the size of the area considered by the agents should also be variable.  The map should have an updating feature.

The purpose of the created ABM is to analyze the effects of changing the scale on the amount of time required to complete the simulation.

I should consider whether it would be better to use DEVS for the model specification, or to use a separate method.  If DEVS is used, a separate model may be required for the landscape and agent representations.

A simple agent-based model could represent people as agents that use trees as a resource.  The people would want to move to an area with the greatest number of trees.  A person has limited area of vision and travels based on visible resources.  When a person reaches the most appealing visible area, he settles and consumes the resources of the area.  A person cannot settle an area being used by another person.

The resources of the landscape are decreased by the people occupying the area.  The resources slowly accumulate when not occupied.  This may best be represented as a composable cellular automaton.

The composability of the agent and landscape representations may become an issue.
